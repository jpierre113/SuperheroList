# Superhero List

Single page frontend application that lists superheroes from a [REST API](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/). Clicking on the hero's image will display their power stats in a modal.

## Technologies Used

- TypeScript
- ReactJS
- CSS(Bootstrap)

## Installation
- Open a terminal/command line
- Clone the repository to any location on your computer
- Cd into the SuperheroList folder
- Run npm install
- Then npm run start and it will open a localhost:3000 page in default web browser

### Possible Improvements
- Implementing infinite scrolling, Currently the application displays all heroes in the API, my goal would be to display a few at a time and when user scrolls to the bottom of the page it would load the next set of heroes
